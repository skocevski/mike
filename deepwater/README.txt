DeepWater User Interface mock-up.

The Interface consists of 5 html files and css file.

1. index.html - is the first page where the User is able to enter username and password and begin with the simulation. Currently there is now validation of the User's input, thus the button's function is only to redirect to the next page. 

2. dashboard.hmtl - is the second page where the User can see the current rig status. 

3. rignews.html - This page is where the User can see all the News of the current phase. Also he can track how many phases he has passed and how many are to follow. All the news that the User has not seen of the current phase are easily noticable. The old news that he has already seen of the current phase are shown at the bottom of the screen. As a content of the news is taken Lorem Ipsum random text generator and can be easy replaced. 

4. goals.html - Here are shown all the goals that the User has to achieve. When he acomplishes any of the goals, the text gets overlined. Also at the bottom of this area is given a meter which measures the percentage of the entire fulfilment of the goals for the current phase. In this screen also are stated the goals description and the users account. As in rignews.html, here also is taken text from Lorem Impsum random text generator as a content of the page.

5. decisions.hmtl - The only interactive screen for the user, where he can choose whether to proceed or to wait. Using dropdown list to the user is given chose from which he picks one option. Afte the selection, he cannot procceed to the next phase until he confirms his choise by clicking the Submit button. After the Submit button is pressed he will not be able to change the option and can only proceed to the next phase, which will redirect the User to dashboard.html
